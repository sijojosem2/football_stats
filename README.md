Data Engineer Challenge
1. Create an ETL job in Python to import all available season’s data of the English
Premier League (PL) competition. For this you will need to use the free RESTful
API football-data.org (consider how to manage the response in order to transform the
data to fulfill the next steps).
2. Download the data as a CSV file(s).
3. Write the DDL statements of two tables (seasons & teams) defining which columns
are required to store the downloaded data.
4. Make a ER diagram of how the tables will relate to each other
5. Create a SQL query that will output all the teams that have won at least 3 times the
Premier League since 2000-08-19. Show the team’s name and how many titles it has
won.
6. (EXTRA not mandatory but nice to have) Create a SQL query that will list the name
of the teams that have won the Premier League, the start date of the winning
season(s) and the end date of the winning season(s), considering that if a team wins
consecutive seasons the winning dates should range from the start of the first
winning season until the end of the last consecutive winning season.
7. (EXTRA not mandatory but nice to have) include a function in your Python code to
import the English Premier League team’s data.

Remarks
● Feel free to use the RDBMS of your choice for loading the data
● Football-data.org is a Free RESTful API
● Please include all the assumptions you made when solving these tasks
